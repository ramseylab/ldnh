Description: Process square-wave voltammograms that are provided in
             an Excel spreadsheet of melted data (with columns `potential`,
             `device`, `conc`, and `current`) using the "LDNH" method, which
             stands for Logarithm, Detilting, Normalization, and Hessian.
             Outputs a dot-plot of the signal vs. concentration curve and also
             outputs an Excel spreadsheet of the signal vs. concentration data.
